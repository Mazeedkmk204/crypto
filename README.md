Welcome to the React Coin Tracker App! This application was developed to showcase my proficiency in React JS, API integration, user authentication using Firebase, and dynamic routing with React Router DOM. Below, you'll find an in-depth overview of the key features and technologies used in this project.

ðŸ“‹ Features
User Authentication: Users can easily create accounts using their email addresses and securely sign in. This feature enables users to save their favorite coins to a personalized list.

Firestore Cloud Storage: A Firestore database is dynamically created at the time of user registration, providing seamless storage and retrieval of user-specific data.

Dynamic Routing: Utilizing the "React Router DOM" package, the app implements dynamic routing, enhancing the user experience by providing smooth navigation between different sections of the application.
